This is a basic HTML 5 game similar to Frogger. The player starts on the grass blocks and has to make it
to the water at the other end. Watch out! Giant bugs are trying to stop you. If they catch you,
you will start again at the starting position.

In order to play the game:

1) Unzip the file

2) Open index.html file

3) The game should load up. Have fun!
